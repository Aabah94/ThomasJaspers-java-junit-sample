# java-junit-sample

This project is meant to show the usage of JUnit, Mockito and Powermock for unit testing in Java.
To be able to show some "real" examples a kind of dummy application is provided here to have some
usecases for the different tests. The dummy application does really nothing, but it has some of the
patterns we might encounter in testing like usage of a repository and some static methods from some
tool-like classes. Not that this might be the best design, but I think we often see this in real life.
If not, even better and probably easier for unit testing.
